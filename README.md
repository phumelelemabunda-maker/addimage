        Hello, my name is Phumelele Mabunda, and I am from South Africa.
        I am currently studying web development through BYU-Pathway Worldwide,
        where I am currently learning how to design and develop websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        I have always been fascinated by technology and the internet, which led me to pursue
        a career in web development.I am excited about the opportunities in this field and continue 
        to grow my knowledge and skills.
